|forced\_uninstall|boolean   | This is Deprecated.  Use unattended\_uninstall |
|installable\_condition|string    | NSPredicate string that must evaluate true for this item to be allowed to install. Same format as used in [ConditionalItems](ConditionalItems.md), but is used only to filter whether the item _can_ be installed on the client, not to decide whether it _will_ be installed. See [here](PkginfoFiles#installable_condition.md) for more details.|
|installed\_size|integer   | Size of the installed item.  Used to determine if there is enough free space before install. Typically generated by makepkginfo/munkiimport. |

|installer\_item\_location|string    |Relative path (from the pkgs directory) to the installer item. Typically auto generated. |
|installer\_item\_size|integer   |Size of the installer item. Typically auto generated.|
|installer\_type|string    |This key may be absent, in which case an installer item type of Apple package is assumed. Possible values include AdobeSetup, AdobeUberInstaller, AdobeAcrobatUpdater, !AdobeCS5AAMEEPackage, !AdobeCS5PatchInstaller, copy\_from\_dmg, nopkg and appdmg (deprecated). This key is typically auto-generated.|

|version  |string    |Version number string. Examples: "1.0", "3.6.10"|

## receipts ##
**Array of dictionaries**
<br />Most keys are automatically generated by makepkginfo or munkiimport when importing an Apple package. The only key you might need to add or modify is the "optional" key.

|filename         |string    |                 |

|version          |string    |                 |
|optional         |boolean   | If set to true, Munki won't use this receipt to determine installation state, but will use its information (if present) when removing an installed package |

## installs ##
**Array of dictionaries**
<br />Not all keys appear in every entry. Use `makepkginfo -f /path/to/item` to generate these.

|version\_comparison\_key|string    |When install item is any type but 'file', this is the name of the key to be used for version comparison logic. If unspecified, 'CFBundleShortVersionString' is used. The key and its value must always be included in this install item so that this item can be compared with the version on disk.|
